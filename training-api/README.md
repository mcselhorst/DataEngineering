training-api is not explicitly used in pipelines, but it shows how our best MLP model is trained, which can be fount under /resources/train_heart_predictor.py  
In our training pipeline we use a simplified version of MLP, which is bested by the LR model when compared during the training pipeline. However, the model that is deployed during the api/ui build trigger, is the MLP model that is trained using train_heart_predictor.py and can be found under /models/heart_disease_model.h5
